#### 👨‍💻 Who am I?

A **business-tech hybrid** — think of me as someone who can:

- Build a dashboard 📈 & Present a pitch 💬  
- Design a website 🎨 And still explain why your business model won’t scale 🙃  
- Write SQL queries and executive summaries — in the same hour  
- Debug code *and* your team’s group chat dynamics.
- Turn a messy dataset into a business insight (or at least a good-looking chart)  
- Say things like "agile", "ROI", and "MVP" — and actually mean them👓
  
**I blend tech skills with strategic thinking, and throw in event management, storytelling, and a little chaos coordination on the side.
